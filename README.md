# Instructions

## Write a form component that satisfies the following requirements

- The user can edit each of the four fields (first name, last name, company and title).
- When the user submits the form, the app displays the new state.
- When the user cancels the form, the app returns to its initial state.

## Starting and testing the app

- Start the app: `npm start`.
- Run tests: `npm test`.
